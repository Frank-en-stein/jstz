## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Top Risks by Product

**KnowledgeChain**:
- ❌ **Risk**: Pinecone/Weaviate add blockchain features first
- ✅ **Mitigation**: Focus on federated multi-company RAG (they can't do this)

**ToolForge**:
- ❌ **Risk**: OpenAI/Anthropic launch official MCP marketplace
- ✅ **Mitigation**: First-mover advantage, quality guarantees via staking

**TruthAds**:
- ❌ **Risk**: Brave Browser adds AI verification
- ✅ **Mitigation**: Deeper verification (computer vision), multi-platform (not just browser)

**AuthenticPost**:
- ❌ **Risk**: Instagram/TikTok add native verification
- ✅ **Mitigation**: Cross-platform, immutable history (platforms can't provide this)

**Supply Chain Products**:
- ❌ **Risk**: IoT sensor costs too high for SMBs
